# Problems for Future Me

- What happens when a file grows beyond 4GB (which Windows does not like)?
- What info do we store about indexes? The `databases_and_tables.md` does not describe this.
- How do we store rows that exceed the page length?
- PG and MSSQL both seem to track free space. Why? Do I care?
- My text is only UTF-8 I think; Can I support Unicode?
